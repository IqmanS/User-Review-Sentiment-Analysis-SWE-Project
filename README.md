# User-Review Sentiment Analysis SWE Project

This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in user reviews. By utilizing machine learning and text analysis methodologies, this project aims to classify and understand the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) embedded within user-generated content. The goal is to create a robust system capable of automatically determining sentiments expressed in reviews, enabling businesses and organizations to gain valuable insights from customer feedback. This repository contains the code, resources, and documentation necessary to explore, build, and deploy models for sentiment analysis of user reviews.
